	<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">A brief overview of the prevention part of the long-term Erlangen-Nuremberg Development and Prevention Study, which combines a prospective longitudinal&amp;nbsp;and experimental design. Findings up to five years after intervention are reported. From a sample of 609 families with kindergarten children, subgroups participated&amp;nbsp;in the universal prevention program EFFEKT (child social skills training, a parent training and a combination of both) or were assigned to equivalentcontrol groups. The short-term evaluation showed significant effects in mediating constructs (social problem solving and parenting behavior) and in educators&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp;ratings of children&amp;rsquo;s social behavior. In a follow-up after two to three years, school report cards showed fewer children with multiple behavior problems. In a&amp;nbsp;further follow up after four to five years program children reported fewer externalizing and internalizing problems than the control group. There were no significant&amp;nbsp;effects in the mothers&amp;rsquo; reports on their children&amp;rsquo;s behavior. Most significant effect sizes ranged between d = 0.20 and d = 0.40. The findings suggest&amp;nbsp;various positive long-term effects of the intervention. However, one need to be cautious with regard to over-generalizing the positive findings, because effect&amp;nbsp;sizes vary over time and the positive findings could not be replicated in all investigated variables.</dc:description>
