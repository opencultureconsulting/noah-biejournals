      <dc:description xml:lang="en-US">Aim: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of COPD and its associated factors among adults in Albania.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Albania in 2013-14. A nation-wide representative sample of 1200 adults aged â‰¥40 years was selected using multistage cluster sampling technique. All participants were interviewed about socio-demographic characteristics, respiratory symptoms, smoking status and clinical characteristics. Spirometry was performed according to standard methods. COPD was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio &amp;lt;70% predicted.
Results: Of the 1200 adults invited to participate, 939 adults or 78% (467 men and 472 women) were eligible for the study. The overall COPD prevalence (GOLD stage 1 or higher) was 12.4%; it was higher in men (17.4%) than in women (7.7%). Using Lower Limit of Normal (LLN), the prevalence of COPD was 9.9%, again higher in men (13.2%) than women (6.6%). The prevalence of doctor-diagnosed COPD was 1.3% (1.9% in men, 0.6 % in women). Male sex, smoking and increasing age were significantly associated with COPD diagnosis.
Conclusion: The overall prevalence of COPD in Albania was 9.9% using BOLD standards. Smoking and increasing age were the main risk factors for COPD. The study highlights the importance of raising awareness of COPD among health professionals.
