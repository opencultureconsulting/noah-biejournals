	<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">Aim: This study aims to assess the Palestinian girls’ dietary habits and physical activity patterns as a baseline for intervention.Methods: A cross-sectional study of grade 4 and 5 pupils (mean age: 11 years) in 14 all-girl schools in East Jerusalem, of four different types of school ownership (overall N=897), was conducted, using self-administered questionnaires and  height and weight measurements. Logistic regressions were conducted to determine predictors of healthy behaviours.Results: Only 36.6% of the pupils reported eating breakfast daily, with UNRWA schools having the highest rate of daily breakfast consumption (42.6%). About 28% reported eating the recommended daily quantity of five portions of fruits and vegetables. Only 15% of the pupils reported being active at least five days a week and more than one third of the schoolchildren viewed TV for ≥4 hours a day. The  prevalence of overweight and obesity was 22.2% and 7.6%, respectively, with private schools having the highest rates, 29.6% and 12.8% respectively (P=0.001). Additional predictors of overweight and obesity were: being the first child in the family, watching TV for more than four hours a day, always eating while watching TV and being physically active less than five days a week. Conclusions: Most Palestinian pupils miss breakfast, eat less fruits and vegetables than recommended and have sedentary behaviours. These findings raise serious concerns and point to the urgent need for tailored interventions.Source of funding: This study is a part of Ph.D. degree. Maha Nubani-Husseini received a scholarship from Joint Distribution Committee (JDC). She thanks Nutrition and Health Research Institute Al-Quds University for funding part of the research.
