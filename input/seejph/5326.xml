	<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">Background: The impact of the pandemic on medical record health service procedures has induced significant changes. The duplication of Covid-19 patient numbers in the patient medical record unit is an important concern. This study aims to analyze the legal aspects of managing medical record services during the Covid-19 pandemic in hospitals.
Methods: This type of research is descriptive and quantitative with a cross-sectional approach. The key informants are 15 registration and medical record unit officers, using online interview techniques, employed in three hospitals in Semarang with a focus on group discussions. The object of research includes the management of medical records and service standards for Covid-19 patients as regulations in the medical record unit of the Semarang city general hospital.
Results: Policies and standards for medical record services for Covid-19 patients, have not been adjusted to the provisions based on Circular Letter Number HM.01.01/001/III/2020 concerning procedures for work in situations of the Covid-19 outbreak. The medical record service for Covid-19 patients still applies paper-based or semi-electronic medical records so that errors can occur. This can cause legal problems for hospitals; therefore, medical record service standards must meet legal aspects as legal evidence that can protect the interests of various parties.
Conclusions: It is necessary to manage a medical resume form design that is better, complete, electronical, and in accordance with legal aspects.
Conflicts of interest: None declared.
