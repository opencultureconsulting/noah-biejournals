	<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">Aims: This study aims to assess the knowledge of people from Central Africa about Universal Health Coverage and show the contribution of Information-Education-Communication for its adoption.
&amp;nbsp;
Methods: a cross-sectional analytical study across 4 of 6 Central African Countries was conducted. Independent variables are sociodemographic characteristics. Dependent variables are knowledge about Information-Education-Communication and Universal Health Coverage. The questionnaire was disseminated by WhatsApp images or word file or copy/paste of the text and send to the contacted and trained focal points. From the Smartphone, the filmed or transferred data were entered into a CSpro 5.0 input form. Mean score calculations and Odd Ratio with 95 % Confidence Interval for p &amp;lt; 0.005 were used to make associations.
&amp;nbsp;
Results: the Universal Health Coverage had never been heard of by 56.3% of the participants. The Universal Health Coverage was defined as health insurance by (43.9%), free care (30.3%). Respondents with secondary and higher education are more likely to have heard of the UHC than respondents with no education or those with elementary education [OR = 2.95 (1.01-8.64), p = 0.021] and [OR = 4.27 (1.50 â€“ 12.16), p = 0.002] respectively.
&amp;nbsp;
Conclusion: 9.3% of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) population is aware of the Universal Health Coverage; 89.4% of these accept universal health coverage in their country, and 87.4% of them think that the Information Education Communication could enable better adherence to the Universal Health Communication. Implemention of Universal Health Coverage for the general population and adoption of Information-Education-Communication to promote Universal Health Coverage and pool efforts and affiliation procedures in the CEMAC zone is very important</dc:description>
