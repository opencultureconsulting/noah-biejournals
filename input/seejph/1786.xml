      <dc:description xml:lang="en-US">Aim: Behavioural risk factors have a significant impact on health. We aimed to assess health-related behaviour, health status, and use of healthcare services among managers of Slovenian hospitals and institutes of public health.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study which included management (directors, scientific directors, directors’ deputies) of Slovenian hospitals and institutes of public health (63 respondents; 57% women; overall mean age: 51±7 years; response rate: 74%). Data were obtained using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire.Results: About 35% of respondents were directors. More than half of the respondents were overweight or obese (52%), the majority were not sufficiently physically active (59%) and overloaded with stress (87%). Hypercholesterolemia (36%), spinal disease (17%), and arterial hypertension (16%) were most common chronic diseases. Whilst only few participants visited their general practitioner due their health complaints, blood pressure (76%), cholesterol (51%), and glucose (54%) were measured within last year in most of the respondents.Conclusion: Our findings point to a high prevalence of overweight and obesity as well as workplace-related stress among Slovenian public health managers. Therefore, effective preventive strategies should be focused on stress management along with promotion of healthy behavioural patterns.</dc:description>
