      <dc:description xml:lang="en-US">Access to health services is a concern around the world.&amp;nbsp;Different strategies were developed, but&amp;nbsp;Africaâ€™s rate remains the lowest.&amp;nbsp;This article aims to contribute to the population's access to healthcare,&amp;nbsp;and to assess the determinants of the use of mutual health insurance by the population of the Ziguinchor region in Senegal.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
Methods: The study is transversal and descriptive, carried out from July to August 2018.&amp;nbsp;Through the quota method we defined the number of patients to be interviewed. Thus, by a geographic stratification according to the departments and a second-degree stratification taking into account the staff of the different hospital departments,&amp;nbsp;392 patients were selected.
&amp;nbsp;
Results: 73% at the Regional Hospital Center and 27% at the Regional Peace Hospital.&amp;nbsp;Response rate: 97%, women 60% and men 40%.&amp;nbsp;The enrollment for women (24%) is slightly higher than that for men (21%).&amp;nbsp;Socio-economic factors. The rate of adherence is the highest of for patients with university level,&amp;nbsp;followed by high school; income:&amp;nbsp; the highest rate for patients with a monthly income between 200,000 and 500,000 FCFA,&amp;nbsp;followed by patients with an income&amp;nbsp;monthly between 100,000 and 200,000 FCFA.&amp;nbsp;Factors linked to the provision of care: the rate of Mutual Health Insurance adherence follows distances from patients' homes.&amp;nbsp;Concerning the relation to satisfaction, education,&amp;nbsp;distance and information are more determining than adherence rate.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
Recommendations: 1) State:&amp;nbsp;actions on education and distance; 2) Sensitizing the population on mutual health insurance; 3) Urging healthcare providers&amp;nbsp;to reduce waiting times and&amp;nbsp;respect schedules as well as appointments.&amp;nbsp;</dc:description>
