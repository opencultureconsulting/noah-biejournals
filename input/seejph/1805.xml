	<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">During the thirties of the twentieth century, German medical doctors immigrated to Turkey. Among them, was the German-Jewish paediatrician Albert Eckstein. In this short biography, the richness of the literature, written by or about Eckstein, will be presented, and altogether combined. Starting from 1937 and further on, Albert Eckstein undertook scientific surveys on childrenâ€™s state of health and health care in the most remote areas of Anatolia. The value of the social-hygienic approach could be recognized, even in this early stage, starting with epidemiological analysis and followed by basic comprehensive health care. Social hygiene, as a young branch of health sciences at the time, was in the position even then to model the health care system for large population groups, at least in countries actively developing health care, as was Turkey of that time. Albert Eckstein and his co-workers, such as Ihsan Dogramaci, stand out as founders of the modern Turkish health care system today and health sciences in this country.</dc:description>
