                    <abstract lang="eng">Aim: Family physicians and general practitioners are currently facing increasing demands to meet patients’ expectations and rapid technological and scientific developments. The aim of this study was to determine the self-perceived level of competencies of primary health care physicians in Kosovo, a post-war country in the Western Balkans.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Kosovo in 2013 including arepresentative sample of 597 primary health care physicians (295 men and 302 women; mean age: 46.0±9.4 years; response rate: 90%). A structured self-administered questionnaire was used in order to determine physicians’ competencies regarding different domains of the quality of health care. The questionnaire included 37 items organized into six subscales/domains. Answers for each item of the tool ranged from 1 (“novice” physicians) to 5 (“expert” physicians). An overall summary score (range: 37-185) and a subscale summary score for each domain were calculated for each participant. General linear model was used to assess the association of physicians’ self-perceived level of competencies with covariates.Results: The internal consistency of the whole scale (37 items) was Cronbach’s alpha=0.98. Mean summary score of the 37-item instrument and subscale summary scores were all higher in men than in women. In multivariable-adjusted models, mean level of self-perceived competencies was higher among older physicians, in men, those with &amp;gt;10 years of working experience, physicians serving &amp;gt;2500 people, specialized physicians and those involved in training activities.Conclusion: Our study provides useful evidence on the self-assessed level of competencies of primary health care physicians in post-war Kosovo. Future studies in Kosovo and other transitional settings should identify the main determinants of possible gaps in self-perceived levels of physicians’ competencies vis-à-vis the level of physicians’ competencies from patients’ perspective.</abstract>
